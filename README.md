*Smart Light System*
This project uses an ATmega328P microcontroller and C programming in Microchip Studio to automate living room lighting. It adjusts light intensity 
based on natural light and displays levels on an LCD (HIGH, MODERATE, LOW). The system also features motion detection, turning lights on with motion
and off after a set period of inactivity.
